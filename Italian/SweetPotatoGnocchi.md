## Ingredients
- Sweet Potatoes (1 lb)
- Flour (1 cup)
- Salt
- Parsley (bunch)
- Walnuts (handful)
- Garlic (3 cloves)
- Olive Oil (1/4 cup)

1. Pierce the sweet potatoes with a fork and bake them for 35 min until soft on the inside.
1. Cut them in half and scoop the insides out in a bowl
1. Add a generous pinch of salt and gradually mix in 1-1.5 cups of flour. First mix with a fork, then switch to kneading with your hands on a well-floured flat surface. Look for a specific consistency, not an exact flour amount. You're looking for a soft, non-sticky playdoh consistency.
1. Divide the dough into 4 even parts and roll each part into relatively thin ropes/rolls.
1. Cut each dough rope into small gnocchi pieces. Coat them in a thin layer of flour until use.
1. Add all the sauce ingredients in a blender and blend until a smooth thick sauce is formed.
1. Cook the the gnocchi in a pot of salted boiling water until they float up to the surface.
1. Add a generous amount of your sauce to a hot pan along with a ladleful of gnocchi cooking water. Stir together until a thick pasta sauce is formed.
1. Toss the cooked gnocchi with the sauce until well coated. Serve with some lemon zest and optionally some feta cheese.
