1. Add all ingredients into a large pot
2. Let it simmer for about 2 hrs
3. After 2 hrs, spoon out the chiles and the onion, and blend it with some broth and add it back in
4. You should get a nice, rich colored broth in the pot, then let that simmer until meat is pull-apart tender
5. Add that meat to a bowl, sauce it up with the pot broth
