2. Allow to cool slightly, shred chicken and season to taste with paprika, adobo, garlic powder, salt.
3. Add potatoes and mix thoroughly.
4. Heat up tortillas in microwave until soft
    - *My mom's method:*
        - Place 5~10 tortillas in a ziplock bag (sandwich sized) and put a couple droplets of water in the bag as well
        - Heat for ~30 seconds
4. Roll the taquitos with the chicken-potato filling
5. Seam side down, cook in hot oil for few minutes until golden and crispy on all sides
6. Place taquitos on paper towels to drain oil

## Dish Presentation
