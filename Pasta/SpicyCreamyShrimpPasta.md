  - Cajun Seasoning (Optional)
1. Add 2 tbsp of unsalted butter (1 inch cube)

1. Once cooked, remove and set aside the shrimp

## Cooking the Rest
1. Add another 2 tbsp of butter into saute pan (don't clean it off from cooking shrimp)
1. Add in the chopped onion and minced garlic

1. Once the cheese is nice and melted, stir it around and add back in the pasta
1. Continue to stir to coat the pasta with the sauce
1. Add the shrimp back in (optionally: save some shrimp to garnish the plate)
