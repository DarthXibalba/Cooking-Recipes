- Eggs (2)
- Ramen Noodles

- Scallion (2)
- Bone-In Chicken Thighs (2)

## 1. Stock
- Chicken
- Bok Choy
- Scallion
- Ginger root
  
### Prep
1. [De-bone the chicken](https://youtu.be/9gNIqtmYg5o?t=126) thighs by carving around the bone, and once the bone is exposed, go under it with a knife to sever it off.
1. Cut the root (bottom white part) of the bok choy & the scallions
1. Take the ginger (washed) and cut some thumb-sized slices off (4 or 5), leaving the skin on

### Broth
1. Take a pan and apply high heat
1. Toss in the bones with the aromatics (bok choy roots, scallion roots, and ginger slices)
1. Add 4 cups of water and a pinch of salt
1. Possibly add serrano pepper for spice
1. Cook broth for 30 minutes

## 2. Aromatic Oil
1. Take the chicken thighs with the skin on and salt on both sides
1. Place the chicken in a pot (where the entire ramen will come together in) and place on a medium heat & slowly start to render out the fat
1. Meanwhile, peel your ginger and mince up 1-2 tbsp of ginger (depending on how much kick you want in the aromatic oil)
1. Mince up 1 tsp of serrano or jalapeno pepper (optional)
1. Once the chicken is crispy on both sides, take them out
1. Toss in the ginger (and optional minced pepper) into the oil on a medium low heat (do not want ginger to burn)
1. Once ginger is carmelized/browned, collect ginger and set aside for a topping later (leave the oil in the pan)

## 3. Tare (Miso)
3 kinds of Tare:
- Shio (salt based)
- Shoyu (soy based)
- Miso

1. Add miso paste to oil cook it for 2 minutes
2. Pop open the broth pot and slowly start merging the borth and miso oil mix.
3. Continue to slowly drizzle in the broth to turn it into a soup
4. Taste test

## 4. Toppings
1. Once all the liquid has been emptied from the broth pot, fill it up with water once again (you can leave the broth ingredients in there), and bring the water to a boil
1. Gently lower/repeatedly dip the eggs to allow them to get used to the heat without cracking
1. Boil for 6 minutes for half boiled (12 min for hard boiled)
1. Meanwhile, prepare the final garnish by grabbing the scallion green tops and gently slice them up in diagonal strands/shreds
1. Once egg timer is done, extract the eggs from the boiling water and gently lower/repeatedly dip eggs into cold water before fully lowering
1. Toss the remaining bok choy top into the boiling water to lightly blanch them (1-1.5 min just to soften, if this is made in the soup then they can get soggy and gross) then toss in cold water with the eggs

### Toppings Final Prep
1. Gather your scallion shreds
1. Set the eggs out of the water
1. Gather all the bok choy and squeeze into a ball to get out all the water
1. Peel and wash the eggs
1. Slice up the chicken with skin into ramen-meat-piece sizes

## 5. Noodles
1. Set a ramen bowl near the counter that we'll use later
1. Dump in the ramen noodles into the bowling broth water
1. Ladle the miso soup into the ramen bowl
1. Fish the ramen noodles after cooking for a few minutes
1. Toss in some bok choy, chicken slices, and boiled egg (sliced in half)
1. Toss in scallions and crispy (ginger + chicken skin)
