## Instructions
1. Cut the cucumbers into coin shaped slices, place into a bowl and pour 1/2 tbsp of salt. Let this sit for 15-30 minutes to allow the salt to draw out the moisture in the cucumbers.
1. While waiting for the moisture to draw out:
    - Slice a quarter to half an onion into small bite sized crescent slices
    - Slice some green onions into bite-sized strips
    - Mince anywhere between 5-12 cloves of garlic
1. Remove the excess water from the cucumbers, and toss in the sliced white onion, green onion, and minced garlic.
1. Then add to the bowl:
    - 2 tbsp of gochugaru
    - 2 tsp of fine white sugar
    - 1/4 cup of rice wine vinegar
    - 1/4 cup of sesame oil
    - sprinkle in sesame seeds
1. Mix the bowl thoroughly, then place in tupperware or similar container, and place in the refridgerator for at least 30 minutes (but best would be overnight).
1. Enjoy as a side dish, served with rice and some kind of grilled meat!
