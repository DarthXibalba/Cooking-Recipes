## Instructions
1. Prepare your chicken by deboning the thighs and patting the skin dry.
2. Marinate with the ingredients below for 30mins-1 hr.
    - 4 tbsp gochujang paste
    - 1 tbsp gochugaru
    - 1 tbsp sesame oil
    - 3 tbsp brown sugar (or honey)
    - 2 tbsp soy sauce
    - 2 tbsp minced garlic
    - 2-3 tbsp paprika
3. Preheat airfryer to 400Â°F for 5-8 mins.
    - This ensures even cooking in the chicken and a juicier interior! Don't skip on this.
4. After preheating, spray the tray with nonstick oil and lay your chicken skin side down. Airfry for 6-7 mins.
5. Flip, and airfry for another 7-10 mins or until golden to your liking.
6. Serve over steamed rice, veggies, and garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds.
