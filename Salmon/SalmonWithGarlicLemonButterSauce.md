## Ingredients
- **Salmon Fillets**
- **Salt & Pepper**
- **Olive Oil** - to help brown the salmon & prevent sticking
- **Chicken Broth** - to create sauce. White wine will work great too.
- **Fresh Lemon** - add bright flavor, perfect complement to salmon
- **Garlic** - for another layer of flavor
- **Butter** - for richness
- **Honey** - to balance out the tartness of the lemon
- **Parsley** - for a nice colorful garnish

## Prepare Salmon
1. Season salmon with salt & pepper
2. Glaze salmon with half a lemon

## Make the Lemon Butter Sauce
1. In a small saucepan, melt 1 tsp butter over medium heat
2. Add garlic and saute for 1 min
3. Pour in chicken broth and lemon juice
4. Let sauce simmer until it has reduced by half (about 3 min)
5. Stir in butter and honey, set sauce aside
6. Cook salmon

## Detailed Ingredients
- 4 (6 oz) skinless salmon fillets (about 1 inch thick)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tsp olive oil
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth
- 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
- 3 tbsp butter diced into 1 tbsp pieces
- 1 tsp unsalted butter
- 1/2 tsp honey
- 2 tbsp minced fresh parsley
- Lemon slices for garnish (optional)

## Detailed Instructions
1. Remove salmon fillets from refrigerator and allow to rest at room temperature 10 minutes. 
2. Meanwhile, prepare the garlic lemon butter sauce. In a small saucepan, melt 1 tsp butter over medium heat. 
3. Add garlic and saute until lightly golden brown, about 1 - 2 minutes. Pour in chicken broth and lemon juice. 
4. Let sauce simmer until it has reduced by half (to about 3 Tbsp), about 3 minutes. Stir in butter and honey and whisk until combined, set sauce aside.
5. Dab both sides of salmon dry with paper towels, season both sides with salt and pepper. 
6. Heat olive oil in a (heavy) 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. 
7. Once oil is shimmering add salmon and cook about 4 minutes on the first side until golden brown on bottom then flip and cook salmon on opposite side until salmon has cooked through, about 2 - 3 minutes longer.
8. Plate salmon (leaving oil in pan) and drizzle each serving generously with butter sauce, sprinkle with parsley and garnish with lemon slices if desired. Serve immediately.

## Notes
If you want an even richer sauce, you can add an extra tablespoon or two of butter here but I like to keep it on the healthier side so I kept it at a minimal 3 tablespoons (plus the teaspoon to saut√© the garlic) and it's just enough.
