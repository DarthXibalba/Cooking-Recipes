## Ingredients
| Ingredient | Quantity | Additonal Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Water | 5 cups | |
| Beans | 2 cups | Washed whole beans, can be *black*, *pinto*, or *red* beans |
| Onion | ½ an onion | Sliced into crescent pieces, can be *white* or *yellow* onion |
| Garlic | 3 good sized cloves | peeled, slightly crushed |
| Serrano pepper | ½ - ¾ of a serrano pepper | depends on how spicy you want your beans |

| Seasonings | Quantity |
| --- | --- |
| Salt | 2 tsp |
| Cumin | 1 tsp |
| Oregano | 1 tsp |

## Instructions
1. Add all the ingredients (beans, onion, garlic, serrano) into an Instant Pot. **DO NOT ADD SEASONINGS.** *Cooking with salt will make the shell of the beans hard and we want them to soften.*
1. If your Instant Pot has a **Beans** option use that, otherwise cook on **HIGH** for 45 minutes.
1. Once the beans are cooked, release the pressure from the Instant Pot and give it a few minutes to cool down.
1. Add the seasonings (salt, cumin, oregano) and liquidate the mix with an Immersion Blender or similar kitchen tool.
1. Once fully liquidated, transfer over the contents of the Instant Pot into a pot that can be used on a stove top and heat on low for 40-45 minutes.
1. Stir constantly so that the beans do not burn. Stir until the beans reach the desired consistency.
1. Enjoy & store in the refridgerator for later!
